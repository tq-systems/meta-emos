# Unified bootloader package

This directory contains license documentation for multiple bootloader images
for different hardware platforms that may be supported by the installed
upgrade bundle. Only one bootloader image is actually installed on your
hardware, depending on the "Device type" displayed in the Device Settings.

The license information relevant to your installation can be found in the
following files:

- For "hw0200", see the files starting with "mc:em4xx"
- For "hw0210", see the files starting with "mc:em-cb30"
