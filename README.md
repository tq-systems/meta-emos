## Description
The meta-emos project is a Yocto layer maintained by TQ, which contains
definitions for the Energy Manager's operating system. It is integrated
into the em-build build framework with other layers.

## Release
Typically, a release commit updates the distribution version and the
changelogs. The new version must be entered into the `DISTRO_VERSION` variable
in the `conf/distro/emos.conf` file.
